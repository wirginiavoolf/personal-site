<center><em>Death Visits As Often As A Distant Relative</em></center> 
<br><br>
He had a name I could never remember.<br>
He'd pull a coin from behind my ear<br>
then hold it under his tongue all through dinner.<br>
<br>
Junior year of high school, I climbed down<br>
from my bedroom window to meet him<br>
in his tan sedan, cigarette smoke<br>
<br>
ringing out from his kiss-shaped mouth.<br>
I pressed my ear flat against his chest, listening<br>
to his lungs.  That summer, I got so drunk<br>
<br>
the card deck of my hands fell from my sleeves.<br>
I kissed Death out of my best friend's naked<br>
breasts, then tried to wrench him out of my throat<br>
<br>
using the palliative neck of a broken Popov bottle.<br>
I once swallowed enough sand to sleep<br>
for three straight days. My body was like a tomb<br>
<br>
some old Pharaoh's ghost staked out, telling me<br>
how to go and stay at the same damn time. Then the man<br>
with a name I could never remember handed back<br>
<br>
what I'd let him carry for my whole life: the note he kept <br>
in his pocket that held my name, written by my own hand.<br>

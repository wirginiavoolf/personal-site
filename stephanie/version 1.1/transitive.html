<center><em>A Transitive Verb</em></center> 
<br><br>
This is how we will unbutton: to cause an earthquake, which is to say<br>
it was a disc, slipped, like a bone undone. What I look like from behind<br>
walking away.<br>
<br>

<br>
A transitive verb : is to open the folds of : to spread or straighten : expand, <br>
as with an open map.<br>
<br>
<center>*<br></center>
<br>
I like to stop<br>
by continuing to move, like this, away from the first syllable of<br>
I admit.<br>
<br>
<center>*<br></center>
<br>
Twice, I brought the glass bottom down, hard<br>
because of what you had said. I do believe<br>
an omission is not a lie. It feels like the touch<br>
of your shoulders is your attempt to embrace me.<br>
In this effort I am only held when I reach back.<br>
<br>
<center>*<br></center>
<br>
Do not confuse my dreams for centrifuge.<br>
The brain hides fear so deep it cannot be released<br>
except at night, asleep, small hands opening and closing,<br>
opening and closing. A body is sometimes a door<br>
slamming itself shut. A body is sometimes a pupil<br>
getting smaller as one light gets brighter. I keep looking<br>
at you like your face is a spread of tarot cards but I don't know<br>
how to read tarot cards. What I do know is the stars inside of us<br>
are not the same as the stars in the sky. I am a believer<br>
in coincidence: the coin, flipping.<br>

Some say a missed opportunity is glue dried to the cap.<br>
If only it worked more like a faucet and less like a ghost.<br> 
<br>
Last week, I deleted all the messages off the machine<br>
without listening to any.  Later, I called the police on a neighbor<br>
<br>
who put his fist between each tooth in the bevel of his wife's<br>
shiny brass mouth. When they knocked on my door I didn't answer. <br>
<br>
Some say a missed opportunity is like a dead horse.<br>
If only it worked more like a faucet and less like a ghost. <br>
<br>
Once, the man I did not marry punched the wall behind my head<br>
over and over while his baby cried my thighs to wet red. <br>
<br>
Sometimes I spend a whole day under the sheets pretending<br>
to be a ghost. Last week, my new husband took me to the beach. <br>
<br>
The waves were frozen up high and covered in snow. <br>
I wanted to say I know how that feels. Once, a baby stuck<br>
<br>
inside of me like I had been chewing gum in my sleep. I combed<br>
him all out with some red and green pills.  I felt just like a faucet. <br>
<br>
Some say a missed opportunity is like a baby who starts crying<br>
and won't shut up.  Others say all bodies will end up two <br>
<br>
chalk erasers cymbaling together in clouds of unrained skies.<br>

<p>
she played trombone.  In low brass,<br>
she was lodged into a wrist of testosterone,<br>
stood out like a flipped bird, practiced<br>
every day until her lips swelled as pink<br>
as rubber bands. By seventh grade,<br>
she sat first chair and no one talked<br>
about how it meant a boy was second<br>
or what was happening to her chest.<br>
Once, on the bus, some thick skull fugued<br>
its way down her shoulder until those bird-<br>
brained breasts went numb.  By the way, <br>
<br> 
an etude is a practice in kissing. <br>
There's a bumper sticker that reads<br>
horn players have great lips. She was how<br>
everyone learned the word boner.<br>
Their laughter is the sound of fire.<br>
The punchline came before the joke.<br>
The arpeggios were an exercise in defiance,<br>
an emergency exit door swung open, each note<br>
a step on a fire escape going up or down&mdash;<br>
doesn't  matter&mdash;away from the sound<br>
of alarm. It was the first time she was good<br>
at anything and it made her choose: be a woman<br>
or be a thing that's bruised. There's no<br>
forgiveness in some songs.<br>
